My name is Ryan Chong and I am a Digital Media Art Major at San Jose State University. I strive to create new and mesmerizing experiences through different digital mediums, specifically with video games and other digital interactions. Since I was a kid, I’ve been an incredibly emotional person and video games have influenced me greatly over the years. Initially, I was planning to become a computer programmer but I realized that my math skills weren’t as strong as my artistic creativity and imagination. However, coding is still a skill that I enjoy using for digital artworks like video games and websites.
<br><br>
Video games can include intricate stories or provide enjoyable moments for the audience. This can give experiences that may change people’s perspectives of different issues. Video games have inspired me to pursue the goal of creating interactive stories and ideas that will be meaningful to my audience. I believe art that incorporates a users’ input, like video games, is a strong method of accomplishing this because of how they greatly involve the audience in the message the game is trying to communicate.
<br><br>
My artwork initially pursued communicating an idea in an immersive way. At the same time, I also wanted the experience to be enjoyable and memorable. I used HTML and video to create immersive art pieces that also had comedy elements to make the piece more memorable. I also created games using p5.js and javascript. They included short stories that involved the audience’s input to give a sense of participation and involvement in the story. Later in my college education, a game that had greatly inspired me is called “The First Tree” which included a powerful narrative that left me speechless. This game has inspired me to have my art achieve a similar feeling that strongly resonates with the audience. My artwork has slightly shifted to where I focus more on giving the audience a more meaningful idea that can connect to on a deeper emotional level. My latest artwork using video as the medium had fewer comedy elements and had more emotional moments instead. My emotions can potentially have a strong effect on the art that I produce which helps fuel my motivation for an art piece.
<br><br>
I believe that video games and digital art overall will become more immersive as technology continues to evolve rapdily. I foresee technologies like augmented reality to achieve experiences never seen before. New software and smarter AI will result in more possibilities for digital art. A long-term goal I have is to create or be a part of the creation of a video game or digital medium that will have a strong influence on many people in society. A project that portrays a new perspective to an idea or greatly contributes to a positive social movement like fighting climate change. I dream to develop a video game that will be remembered in video game history.
